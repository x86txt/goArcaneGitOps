# Docker Compose Git Sync Configuration
# Copy this file to /etc/sync-tool/config.env and update with your values

# Required: Path to your docker compose git repository
# This is where your git repo is cloned (where you run git commands)
COMPOSE_REPO_PATH=/opt/docker

# Required: Root path where Docker Compose projects are deployed
# Each subfolder should contain a compose.yaml file
# Example: /opt/docker/zerobyte/compose.yaml, /opt/docker/bittorrent/compose.yaml
PROJECTS_ROOT_PATH=/opt/docker

# Required: Arcane API Base URL
# Example: http://localhost:3552 or http://arcane.example.com
ARCANE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3552

# Required: Arcane API Key
# Generate in Arcane UI: Settings → API Keys → Add API Key
# IMPORTANT: Copy the key when created - it won't be shown again!
ARCANE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Optional: Arcane environment ID (defaults to '0')
# Tip: Arcane commonly uses numeric environment IDs like 0.
ARCANE_ENV_ID=0

# NOTE: Projects are auto-detected based on folder names
# The sync tool will:
# 1. List all folders with compose.yaml files in PROJECTS_ROOT_PATH
# 2. Compare with projects in Arcane
# 3. Create missing projects automatically
# 4. Update and redeploy changed projects
# Folder name must match the Arcane project name (e.g., /opt/docker/zerobyte → project "zerobyte")

# Optional: Log file location (defaults to /var/log/sync-tool.log)
LOG_FILE=/var/log/sync-tool.log

# Optional: SSH private key for git operations (for private repositories)
# If set, all git commands will use this key for authentication
# Example: GIT_SSH_KEY_PATH=/root/.ssh/id_rsa
#GIT_SSH_KEY_PATH=/root/.ssh/id_rsa
